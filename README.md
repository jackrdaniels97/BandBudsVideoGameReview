# Jackson Daniels  Individual Project

This repository will serve as the complete code for my Individual Project for Enterprise Java

### Problem Statement

For too long my friends, and I have struggled to find new game to play that we like. We would go to other review sites and 
trust the review of the person on the site that we did not know. I decided that my project would be a site where your
trusted group of friends would create accounts, and you would be able to see what games they have played and what they thought
of those games. This is all in hope that if you want to try out a new game you could go to this site
and look at what your friends have played and then decide what you want to play.
